# Experience SDK

A lightweight, explainable, plugin-based client-side experience runtime built on [@lytics/sdk-kit](https://github.com/Lytics/sdk-kit).

## Key Features

- **Explainability-First** - Every decision returns structured reasons
- **Plugin-Based** - Extensible architecture using sdk-kit patterns
- **Script Tag Ready** - Works without build tools (IIFE bundle)
- **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support
- **Developer-Focused** - Built for debugging and inspection

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @prosdevlab/experience-sdk
```

```typescript
import { createInstance } from '@prosdevlab/experience-sdk';

const experiences = createInstance({ debug: true });

experiences.register('welcome-banner', {
  type: 'banner',
  targeting: { url: { contains: '/' } },
  content: { title: 'Welcome!', message: 'Thanks for visiting' }
});

const decision = experiences.evaluate();
console.log(decision.reasons); // ['URL matches', 'Frequency cap not reached']
```

## What Makes It Different

Every decision includes human-readable reasons explaining **why** an experience was shown or hidden:

```json
{
  "show": true,
  "experienceId": "welcome-banner",
  "reasons": [
    "URL matches '/'",
    "Frequency cap not reached (1/3 this session)",
    "User targeting passed"
  ],
  "trace": [...],
  "metadata": {...}
}
```
