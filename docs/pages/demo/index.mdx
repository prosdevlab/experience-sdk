# Interactive Demo

Experience the SDK in action with a live, interactive demo that showcases the **explainability-first** decision engine.

## 🎯 [Banner Demo](/demo/banner)

See how the Experience SDK evaluates and renders a banner experience in real-time.

**Features showcased:**
- ✅ Real-time decision evaluation
- ✅ Frequency capping (3 per session)
- ✅ Explainable reasons (why show/hide?)
- ✅ Step-by-step execution trace
- ✅ Full context visibility

## What You'll Learn

The demo demonstrates the **core value proposition**: understanding **when** and **why** an experience shows or hides.

### 1. **Decision Engine**
   - Click "Simulate Page View" to trigger evaluation
   - Watch frequency cap in action (0/3 → 3/3)
   - See banner hide after cap is reached

### 2. **Explainability Output**
   - **Reasons**: Human-readable explanations
     - "✅ URL matches targeting rule"
     - "Frequency cap not reached (2/3 this session)"
   - **Trace Steps**: Machine-readable execution log
     - Timing per step (milliseconds)
     - Input/output for each evaluation
   - **Context**: Full snapshot of evaluation state

### 3. **Realistic Behavior**
   - Banner persists across page refreshes (sessionStorage)
   - Reset button clears frequency cap for retesting
   - Accurate impression counting

## Why This Matters

Unlike traditional personalization tools, **Experience SDK** focuses on:

1. **Transparency** - Every decision has structured reasons
2. **Debuggability** - Trace execution step-by-step
3. **Testability** - Simulate scenarios without deployment
4. **Developer Experience** - Built for engineers who need to understand "why"

This is the **decision layer** between:
- **User context** (provided by analytics/CDP like jstag3) ← WHO they are
- **Experience rendering** (your UI components) ← WHAT to show

**You control WHEN** with explainable logic.
